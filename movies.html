	<h1>The Best Action Movies According to Joseph</h1>
		<h2>My top three action movies of all-times.</h2>
		<hr/>
		<h3>'Seven Samurai' (1954)</h3>
		<p>It's simply an undeniably satisfying and exciting story. <br/>The inhabitants of a small village
		become tired of constant bandit attacks, <br/>and set out to find samurai who will help them defend themselves.<br/>
	It uses 3.5-hour runtime to develop characters and build suspense, <br/>making the climate battle scenes all the more
exiting in the process.</p>
	
		<h3>'High and Low' (1963)</h3>
		<p>It's a fairly lengthy film at 142 minutes long, but is paced and plotted extremely well,<br/>
	ensuring that it doesn't feel its length. It's also got an amazing cast filled with numerous<br/>
	actors Kurosawa worked with on more than one occasion (including Toshiro Mifune),<br/>
	and the way its simple premise expands out and becomes more tense <br/>
	and complex as the film progresses makes it riveting to watch.</p>

	<h3>'Ikiru' (1952)</h3>
	<p>Ikiru is likely Akira Kurosawa's most bittersweet and moving film.<br/>
	It has a simple story that delivers a wide array of emotions, <br/>
	centering on a bureaucrat whose perspective on life is dramatically changed <br/>
	when his doctor tells him he's terminally ill and won't have long to live.</p>
